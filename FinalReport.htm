  <p style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>            We often hear the term ‘ghetto’ used to describe a city
    or town where people usually live due to a combination of social, economic,
    and/or legal pressures. Many of the people who live in such areas struggle to
    survive on minimal incomes, and are often portrayed in the media as people who
    will steal and commit crimes in order to gain small luxuries in their lives.
    With this in mind, we wanted to find out if a significant gap in income between
    an affluent area and a low-wage area would be reflected in each area’s crime
    rates. We feel that our resulting project, and more in-depth projects similar
    to our own, will in the near future be able to aid crime enforcement in better
    locating the parts of their city in which crime is most prevalent.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>According
    to the FBI, when assessing crime rates, one must consider many variables, some
    of which, while having significant impact on crime, are not readily measurable
    or applicable pervasively among all locales. Such factors could include but not
    be limited to racial and ethnic makeup, age and gender composition, education
    levels, and family structures.  Geographic and demographic factors specific to each jurisdiction must be
    considered and applied if one is going to make an accurate and complete
    assessment of crime in that jurisdiction. (“Variables Affecting Crime”).</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Without
    ignoring the FBI’s warning on crime rate statistics, we wanted to test the
    simple question as to whether or not income was a contributing factor in crime
    rates.   Most reasonable people would
    assume that as median household income decreases in an area, crime rates
    increases in that area.  Does it?  Is there a correlation between the two and to
    what extent?  One way of testing this is
    to build a GIS model to determine if there is a correlation between crime rates
    and median household income.  According
    to the US Census bureau’s population estimates for the year 2010, Tempe is the
    8<sup>th</sup> largest city in Arizona with an estimated 161,719 people (“Tempe
    Today”).  A GIS model of the city of
    Tempe should provide a large enough sample to determine the correlation, if
    any, to median household income and crime rates. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Literary
    Review</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>There
    is very little information in peer-reviewed journals regarding possible
    correlations between crime rates and income in a given area. There are however,
    a substantial number of studies regarding inequality and crime, which suggests
    that income disparity between two neighboring areas may play a significant factor
    in crime rates. It is suggested that the connections between crime rates and
    level of inequality is as strong within urban areas as it is across countries,
    and that envy is much easier to be directed at those who live closer to us
    (Glaeser, 617).  If this is indeed
    correct, then one might be able to assume that areas of a city such as Tempe
    where income is below the city-wide average will see significantly more crime
    than areas of Tempe where average household income is much higher.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Rundle
    et al. discovered in their 2009 article in the Journal of Public Health Policy
    that lower-earning census tracts within New York City had significantly fewer
    street-side trees, clean streets, and sidewalk cafes. Furthermore, these poorer
    census tracts had higher rates of felony complaints, drug-related arrests, and
    vehicular-related accidents. This study by Rundle et al. would provide a good
    deal of information in regards to how we should expect our own project to turn
    out, mainly due to the large scope on which their research took place. Our own
    research project consisted of a total of 32 census tracts, whereas the similar
    project undertaken by Rundle et al. consisted of a total of 2,172 census
    tracts.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Addy
    et al. suggests that environmental factors, such as level of income, play an
    important role on influencing physical activities. Areas with low socioeconomic
    status were seen to have significantly higher crime rates as well as general
    displeasure with their neighborhood and feelings of untrustworthiness around
    neighbors (20). As with the other research into crime and income correlations
    which we found, this suggests that an area’s average household income will
    reflect significantly upon the prevalence of crime in that area.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Lyons-Ruth
    et al. conducted research on mothers who came from low-income areas who were
    the victims of some sort of abuse during their childhood. They found that among
    45 mothers who came from these conditions, approximately 58% committed some
    sort of criminal abuse or neglect towards their child while they were still in
    their developmental years (271). These findings suggest that average household
    income may be one of the prevailing factors behind the likelihood of a child
    becoming a victim of early-developmental child abuse.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Methodology</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>To
    accomplish our research we used data from our class instructor, along with information
    from the 2010 US Census. We took a list of crimes which occurred within the
    city of Tempe in the year 2010 and geocoded each crime by address to a map of
    Tempe which we created via a map of Arizona downloaded from the US Census
    Bureau. We imported each of these files into ArcMap, and then used Spatial
    Analyst to get a count of the number of crimes in each of the 32 census tracts.
    Next, we imported an excel file containing each of the 32 census tracts along
    with their 2010 median household income, which we obtained from the US Census
    Bureau. We proceeded to join this file to the Tempe map layer file using the
    Tract field, which allowed us to create an income-based map of Tempe to compare
    with the geocoded crime map. Using the resulting income-based map of Tempe, we
    were finally able to look for any significant correlations between median
    household income and number of crimes in that area throughout the entire city.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Limitations</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In
    the process of conducting our research we encountered some intricate challenges
    along the way. During the process of collecting our data, we came across crime
    records for the city of Tempe from the years 2003 to 2008. While this data
    contained over 70000 instances of crime in Tempe over a six-year period, they
    lacked addresses of where the crimes took place, and their locations were based
    solely upon city voting districts. We found this to be problematic, since the
    only Tempe income data which we could find from a reliable source was based on
    census tracts.   </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>To
    resolve this issue our instructor gave us a list of 2010 Tempe crime data with
    addresses where each crime occurred, which allowed us to map occurrences of
    crime via tract so that we could compare crime rates to average household
    income. Further complications occurred when we were attempting to map this list
    of 2010 crimes to addresses. Out of the approximately 15,000 crimes listed in
    our 2010 data, a total of approximately 7800 crimes were properly mapped in
    ArcMap. We decided that this was still a significantly large number of crime on
    which we can research, and felt that within our given timeframe it would be
    acceptable to continue our data analysis with these 7800 crimes.</span></p>

line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>            From our results, we can see that there is a significant
    correlation between the average household income in a census tract and the
    number of crimes that occurred in the year 2010 in that given track. In the
    year 2010, the poverty line for a family of four in the United States was
    $22,050. Knowing this, we can see that there are three census tracts (319101,
    319102, 3187) which fall within $10,000 of the national poverty line. Out of
    the total 32 census tracts, these three tracts alone accounted for
    approximately 13.76% of the total crime in Tempe in 2010. The correlation between
    income and crime rates is even further exemplified when one looks at the three
    highest earning tracts. Out of 32 census tracts, the three highest earning
    tracts (319907, 522720, 319910) accounted for only 4.85% of total Tempe crime.
    This means that the three lowest-earning census tracts had a crime rate that
    was a startling 284% higher than the rate seen in the three highest-earning
    tracts.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Conclusion
    and Future Research</span></b></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>            The information we found through our research suggests
    that there may be some significant correlation between income rate in a
    particular area and that area’s crime rate. While this suggests that level of
    income has a significant effect on an area’s overall crime rate, we must still
    take into account the other factors that may affect crime rates. An area such
    as downtown Tempe may have a relatively high crime rate in comparison to its
    population, and as a result the average household income in that area may not
    appropriately reflect crime rates. Median age may also play a significant role
    in an areas overall crime rate. One might assume that an area filled with
    well-to-do retired seniors may see significantly lower crime than another
    nearby area filled with families in their 20s and 30s whom never completed any
    sort of college degree.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;'>            In the future, our research should be expanded in order
    to account for other factors which significantly affect crime rates. As
    suggested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, crime rates are influenced by
    a number of factors including but not limited to racial/ethnic makeup, median
    age, education level, and family structure. These factors, along with
    overcrowding due to population, should be researched in-depth to see what
    effects, if any, they have on crime rates. It is our hope that in the near
    future there will be more in-depth studies into these factors and their effects
    on crime rates, as they can both assist law enforcement in concentrating their
    efforts on serious commonly-occurring crimes, and better inform the public of
    how they can protect themselves and others from falling victim to crimes.</span></p>
